# NexWallet Implementation for Stellar/Soroban

This document explains the architecture of the NexWallet implementation for Stellar/Soroban and compares it with the Ethereum implementation.

## Architecture Overview

The NexWallet for Stellar/Soroban follows a similar modular design pattern as the Ethereum implementation, with adaptations specific to the Soroban environment:

### Core Components

1. **Wallet Contract**: The main contract that manages assets and interactions with plugins
2. **WalletFactory Contract**: Creates and manages wallet instances
3. **SoroswapPlugin Contract**: Specialized plugin for interacting with Soroswap DEX

## Ethereum vs. Stellar Implementation Comparison

### Similarities

1. **Modular Plugin Architecture**: Both implementations use plugins for extending functionality
2. **Factory Pattern**: Both use factory contracts to deploy and manage wallet instances
3. **Access Control**: Both have owner-based access control for sensitive operations
4. **DEX Integration**: Both provide integration with DEX protocols (PancakeSwap/Uniswap on Ethereum, Soroswap on Stellar)

### Key Differences

1. **Smart Contract Language**:
   - Ethereum: Solidity
   - Stellar: Rust with Soroban SDK

2. **Asset Handling**:
   - Ethereum: Uses ERC-20 token standard
   - Stellar: Uses Soroban token interface

3. **Transaction Execution**:
   - Ethereum: Uses function selectors and ABI encoding
   - Stellar: Uses contract invocation with serialized parameters

4. **Signature Verification**:
   - Ethereum: Uses ECDSA with Ethereum-specific recovery
   - Stellar: Uses Soroban's native signature verification

5. **Contract Deployment**:
   - Ethereum: Direct deployment through factory
   - Stellar: Uses Soroban's deployer pattern with WASM hashes

## Soroswap Integration

The Soroswap integration in the Stellar implementation is similar to PancakeSwap/Uniswap integration in Ethereum:

1. **SoroswapPlugin**: Wraps interactions with Soroswap router and factory contracts
2. **Supported Operations**:
   - Swap tokens
   - Add liquidity
   - Remove liquidity

### Implementation Details

1. **Parameter Serialization**:
   - For executing Soroswap operations, parameters are serialized to BytesN<32>
   - Results are returned as serialized BytesN<32>

2. **Token Approvals**:
   - The wallet approves the Soroswap router to spend tokens

3. **Path Routing**:
   - Supports multi-hop routing for token swaps using path arrays

## Security Considerations

1. **Authorization**:
   - Wallet owner must explicitly authorize plugins
   - Only admin can register plugins in the factory

2. **Multi-signature Support**:
   - Operations can be authorized by multiple signers
   - Signatures are verified before executing operations

3. **Upgradeability**:
   - Wallet WASM can be updated for new deployments
   - Existing wallets cannot be upgraded (immutability principle)

## Technical Implementation Choices

1. **Soroban-Specific Features**:
   - Use of contracttype for structured data
   - Env pattern for contract context
   - Storage abstractions for persistent data

2. **Serialization**:
   - Custom serialization for cross-contract parameter passing
   - Use of BytesN for compact parameter representation

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Explicit error messages for better user experience
   - Validation checks before performing operations

## Future Enhancements

1. **Additional Plugins**:
   - Lending protocol integrations
   - Cross-chain bridging
   - Batch transaction processing

2. **Advanced Security**:
   - Transaction simulation
   - Gas optimization
   - Enhanced signature verification
